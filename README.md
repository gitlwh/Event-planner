# Meet-Up Event Planner
This is the first project for Senior Web Developer Course at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). Sadly, it was cancelled by Udacity after two months, I got all refund back and this project left. Well, OK. This sounds not that sad. I read a lot of documents from Internet and also, read others' code (especially [Patrick's](https://github.com/PatrickO10) code), which really help me a lot. I will try more web app in the future.

## Features:
1. Allows users to make an account or login to existing account!
